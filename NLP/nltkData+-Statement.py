to be reassigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army  \nlawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i  \nshot in panavisions famed super 70mm format  the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word

into the movie  although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers  \nthe story  as has much of patlabor before  centers around the controversial babylon project  a gigantic seawall that will  on its completion  allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay  \nthis project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists  most

it believable  \nbelievability aside though  its still annoying  \nnow despite all this negativity  and im not alone here    supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles

the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries  \nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that theres no dead air on the track  \nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen  and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation  \nalthough  at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc  and is surprised when he doesnt get that response  \nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track  most notably the  almost

early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission  \nfor the sake of brevity  i wont even get into that one  \nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds  and everyone else agreed  that supergirl needed to stand on its own  replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy

rather than tear them up  \neverything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times beforeand much betterso theres an absence of suspense  and the film ultimately moves at such a very  very deliberate pace  as if it is trying to make great   meaningful  statements and plot developments  that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through  \n

of the typed message  and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake  theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks  a boating town in north carolina  to find out the specifics of the message  \nof course  garrett turns out to be a handsome  rugged man around theresas age and played by kevin costner  \nshe is immediately charmed by him  but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she

the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman  as garretts stubborn  but loving father  are far above par to be in such a wasteful   shaggy dog  love story  and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast  and paints chicago as an equally alluring city  \nmeanwhile  costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the lessthanstellar

garrett  with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining  \nusually  i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogueladen sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships  but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt  written   and not as if people were really  talking   \nwhen the main

being dwarfed by the technology which they created  \nnow comes gattaca  another film about technology reigning supreme  except here on our planet  \nthe difference between 2001 and this one is simple  gattaca is more frightening  \nmost of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering  \nusing this premise  writerdirector andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills  \nunfortunately  due to a lack of advertising  i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office  \nsince seeing the film  i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca  \nlately  however  i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca  \nmost people dont even realize that it is a film  \ndespite this fact  i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it  \nniccols film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter  better produced  and more realistic  \ngattaca begins in the 21st century  \nprocreating is now done in a petri dish  and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it  \nnatural child birth is considered oldfashioned  \nwe are introduced to jerome morrow  ethan hawke   an employee of the gattaca space program  \none of the directors of the program has been murdered  and the main suspect is one vincent freeman  \nthe only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman  \nvincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love  \nhowever  after his birth  and through several genetic tests  doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99 chance of a weak heart  as well as poor eye sight and a short life span  \nas a result  both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics  \nanton  loren dean  is produced without flaws  and the competition between brothers spawns  \nvincent has a dream to fly a soloflight around the titan  the 14th moon of saturn  but because of his condition  gattaca  and society in general  forces him to do menial labor around the company  \nlabeled an  invalid   vincents dream seems impossible  until he meets a blackmarket dna specialist  german  tony shalhoub   \ngerman introduces him to a  valid  who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident  \njerome morrow  jude law  agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools  urine  blood  skin and hair samples  etc   that he will need to get past gattacas tight security  \nin exchange  vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship  \nafter the murder  however  his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincents eyelashes left at the scene of the crime  \nirene cassini  uma thurman  is a genetically flawed  valid  working for gattaca  and she begins to fall in love with vincentjerome  \ngattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time  \nonly two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years  contact and the arrival  and gattaca will rank among them  \nunfortunately  whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effectsladen films  it normally gets buried  \nthe second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs  \nthe orange glow of gattacas scenes are impressive  but the sets deserve most of the credit  \nthe sets are very well done  creating a futuristic sense  but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers  \nas we look at the designs  we realize that these buildings arent too far into the future  \nthis brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day  \nthe best thing  however  is the plot  \nthe story is more than your average scifithriller  \nat its heart  it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present  \nperhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring  \nwould our society become a bunch of soulless zombies  \nmaybe human nature is a result of mankinds flaws  \nif we get rid of flaws  do we get rid of dreams as well  \nniccols intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well  and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story  or vice versa  \nthe power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters  \nwhile flat may sound like a poor job on niccols part  it actually enhances the meaning behind the story  \nethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor  giving his best performance of his lifetime so far  \nhis curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and  valid  peers  \numa thurman is    well  uma thurman  \nher character is slightly underdeveloped  but the story isnt about her  \nhowever  thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character  \njude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character  \nhe provides several nice touches  and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one  \nloren dean gives a nice performance in his welldeveloped character  \ndean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie  \nalan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank  \nstill  he does a good job  \ngore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles  and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film  \ngattaca is rated pg13 for brief violent images  language  some sexuality  and nudity  \ndespite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film  i wasnt exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty  \nit turned me off slightly  but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have  \nif this had been a typical hollywood film  it would have ended much differently  \nhowever  with all the mindless science fiction films out there  it is nice to have a film which doesnt talk down to its audience  i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding  g  t  c  and a   \ninstead  it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want  a science fiction film with morals behind it  \nwhatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining  \nhopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca    \nand hopefully audiences will too  \np  s  personal note to p  j  gladnick  how dare you call this film the worst film of the year  \ni cant even begin to image what film you do like  \nthat frightens me beyond anything  \n', 'pos'], ['when

\nhe is looking at the world through new eyes  \nit is the last thoughtprovoking moment in the film  \nfrom there on  the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us  \nany significant archetype

the significance of all its symbolism  \nhere are two examples of films that dont simply manipulate for manipulations sake  \nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a

help you decide whether to go out and see it  \nto be fair  i must admit that ive never been very fond of  periodpiece  martial arts moviesthe ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past  \nperhaps its because most of those ive seen were filmed on inferior stock  with either butchered dubbing or allbutillegible subtitling  or perhaps its because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and  in many cases  all but nonexistant  \nin fact  many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end  \nor  for that matter  it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings  armour of god  rumble in the bronx  etc   tend to have more spectacular stunts  often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions  whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts  \nhaving said that  i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above  is one of the better martial arts films ive seen  and i quite enjoyed it  \nsurprised  \nwell  so was i  \ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong feihong  played by jackie chan  who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu  \nwhere he learned this style is uncertain  as his father  wong keiying  ti lung  is steadfast in his opposition to feihongs practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu  \napparently  feihong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore  rather like paul bunyan is for americans  but ive heard very little about this  and could quite well be wrong  so ill leave analysis of that to the people who know it better  \none of my friends points out that the character of wong feihong is also featured in the  once upon a time in china  movies  but i have not yet seen those  \nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy  as are the plots to many such films  but if youre watching a jackie chan film  odds are you arent expecting something on the order of  war and peace   \nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics  and hence  chinas cultural heritage  while overworking  underpaying  and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill  \nhowever  this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the filmfeihongs perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend  supplicate his father  keep his  pregnant  mother  played by anita mui  from fighting  and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs  \nthe macguffin that drives the plot  s  is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners  \nin the beginning  feihong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identicallywrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer  \nin the process  he clashes with another thief  who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng  \nafter feihong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners lackies  thanks to some timely intervention by a generals son  a cameo appearance by andy lau  who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii    comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when feihong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng  \nand so it goes  \nand the plot thickens later on  such as when feihongs girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival  or when feihong and the thief  now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners  are attacked en masse  another grand kungfu movie tradition   but i think ive already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves  \nlets move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies    the \naction  \ntheres plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie    of \ncourse  in a kung fu film  thats to be expected  \nhowever  this isnt just another kung fu movie  this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography  and jackie chan is a genius  \nthe primary martial arts  style  featured in the film is drunken boxing  a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk  \nfurther  for the purposes of this film at least  drunken boxers fight better when they actually are intoxicated    but \ntheres a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor  \nunder normal circumstances  the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid  but jackie pulls it off with flair  \nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper  so ill just say that the fightsespecially the big climactic fight at the endin themselves make the movie worth watching  \nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work  \neven without motor vehicles  well  not counting a train   there are some remarkable stunts in this film  \namong other things  jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals  not once  but at least twice  if you count the outtake shown during the credits   \n  quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database   \nunlike in american films  these stunts are not faked  \ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene  including jackie  ti lung   a better tomorrow  1  2   and anita mui  the  heroic trio  series   rumble in the bronx    \nthe performances are firstrate  especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film  \nthe scene where feihong and his mother conspire literally behind feihongs fathers back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious  as is the scene where feihongs mother  having just revealed that she is pregnant  is threatening to hurt herself  in order to draw her husbands anger away from feihong   \njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years  and hes in fine form all through drunken master ii  \nas far as cinematography is concerned  it certainly works for this film  \nits nothing spectacular  but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s  \nthe picture is crisp and clear  \none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that  at least in the copy i have  the screen was wider than any film ive ever seen on videotape beforealmost a whole 13 of the screen was blocked out above and below  \n  watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can   \nit will be an

earth  patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible  \nas we know from the original  this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet  \nhowever  the

the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay  \nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college  we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles  \nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars  later  it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it   \nthe script uses this effectively  but also manages to provide a wellbalanced plot  \nbeginning with the first man on mars  something i have always dreamed of seeing   i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie  \nand it does it quite well  \nthe characters are all smart  and they know what to do and what not to do  \nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general  george dzundza   and yet  he remains logical in everything he does  \nthere are the obvious flaws of course  mostly lying in the technical aspects  \nthe special effects are only mediocre  and some are just plain bad  \nbut for the most part  they remain believable  i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children   \nalso  the most realistic ones are usually the goriest  ranging from people being torn open  or someones head being blown off  \nhowever  some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience  including a menage a troi that is all but necessary  \nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex  nudity  and gory violence  \nhowever  i tend to disagree  \nwhat were the alien films about  \nand  if an alien species ever did come to earth  and their sole purpose was to destroy us  wouldnt you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible  \nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store  \ni didnt realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with  i just assume it is his parthuman side looking for the most beautiful one   \nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film  \nit is a vast improvement over the first film  at least  \nthe acting is the key element to this film  if it was bad  it would have lowered itself into camp  if it was good  it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens  \nokay  so it isnt that good  \ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting  as his overthetop impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting  \nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around  as she is usually enclosed in a cage  \nhowever  she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent  \noh yeah  and shes quite fun to just plain watch  \nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around  and her performance is probably the best in this film  \nmichael madsen is soso  but he isnt annoying  and he soon becomes rather appealing  with his nice cynic personality   \njames cromwell has a small part  but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor  \nas i say  any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability

project to undergo the frightening task of entering starghers mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell    \na cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours  \ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix  \nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films  particularly the first forty minutes  which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs   the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm  \nthe buzz around this project is that firsttime feature film director tarsem singh  who won many awards for his video of r  e  m  s  losing my religion   wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story  and a good portion of this film supports that theory  \ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments  the cell does feature some remarkable imagery  \nall of the sequences where we delve into someones mind are incredibly beautiful  including the dank mind of stargher  whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h  r  giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video   proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe  \nthe first sequence that takes place in starghers mind is by far the best  featuring one of the most ingenious traps ive ever seen in a film  involving a horse  which no one seeing this film will probably forget   a zoolike display of starghers victims which are animated like marionettes  and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room  \nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant  but alas  the sequences only become more silly as they go along  despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film   \nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images  but at least vincent donofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance  magnified by ten  thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed   \nin my opinion  donofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film  but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful  i  e   \nthe newton boys  feeling minnesota  the thirteenth floor  and the velocity of gary  that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him  \nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though  and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him  \ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film  as it contains heavy doses of both  \nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above  there is also starghers penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs  prior to his catatonia and capture  which will have audiences recoiling  \na sequence where catherine enters starghers mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting  \none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spitlike device  \nas a narrative film  the cell is sorely lacking  \nas a collection of images though  the cell is extremely well done  \nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half  singh has done what he supposedly set out to do  make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together  \nunfortunately  a wellwritten script should have been considered too  because without it the cell just seems like any other music video

probably because they could  or  to be more precise  thought they could  imitate its stunts in the real life  \ndecades later  while refining my own cinematic taste  i began to appreciate and actually like those movies  probably because of overexposure to shootemup idiocy of 1980s ramboids  \nyes  most of the kung fu and other  martial arts  flicks were cheap  they had predictable and formulaic

survive  \nin the same time  the plot  although extremely thin  allowed him even some internal battles  between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own antiviolent philosophy  \nthe

ridiculously dumb aliens  \nhowever below that waferthin plot and onscreen flaws  id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion  \nan idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie  thus maintaining a screenviewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable  no matter how ridiculous  \nid4 was produced under a modest budget of us68 million  a film of such magnitude would have easily been another

such as the veronica laketype sexpot  oneliners galore and a fluffy  if inconsequential plotline  \non the downside  the film actually starts off pretty slowly  with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there  but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy  \nthe sets  on the other hand  were amazing  the production design and costumes were perfect  and the casting ideal  so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man  \nbut it wasnt not long before i was fully engaged by the characters  entertained by the many zingers delivered backandforth between allen and hunt  and actually interested in the resolution of the flick  \ni also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old  parody and actual reinvention  note therons entire female persona that is drenched in film noir very cool   \nof course  films like this  with little or no real tension in the plot  need solid actors to keep you interested in the quickfire dialogue  and once again  allen does a great job in playing his character  who for once  isnt his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband

was openly  sick of seeing  in movies late last year  sorry babe  you were just in too many at the same time    \nanyway  shes really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men  and doesnt miss a beat of allens fastpaced dialogue  \ni didnt care much for her running joke about him  dying  whenever he left a room  but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did    yum  \nyum  \nharumph  but i digress  \nso lets recap  \na great looking picture with a nice jazzy score  some funny oneliners  especially in the second half  a decent plotline  although you shouldnt expect a real mystery or anything  and some solid acting all around  \ni cant say that this is even remotely close to any of allens best work  but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction  especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through  \nits probably better geared towards

terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies  \nwas this wes cravens remedy from making  real  bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn  \nit just seemed cheap to me  \nthen i

your standard horror flick  its also a pretty scary movie  \nif youve seen a million of these kinds of films  you know exactly what is going to happen  \nthis is part of the fun of watching scream

alongside pulp fiction  be the most influential film of the 1990s  \nthis influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs  tingle or television programs such as dawsons creek but to others such as myself  we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors  screenwriters  and directors  \nscream is also an extremely funny movie

the rants of randy  jamie kennedy  and stu  matthew lillard   we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well  the virgin always survives  have sex and youre dead meat   \nnot only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors  \nthe script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own selfsatisfaction  \nin this case

full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker  \nworld depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating  \nscorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence  hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime  yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny  \nafter being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history  based on some notorious real life events   the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths  trading the superficial and shortlasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens  \nscorsese also manages to break viewers moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material  scenes that depict personal tragedies  broken homes  human depravity  violence  bloodshed and murder  in all their uncompromising reality  but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience  \nwith the use of ironic soundtrack  manipulative shots  characters dialogue or narrators commentary  goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era  \neven if we dont pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining  we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker  \nfirst  we might notice unusual structure of the plot  relatively minor subplot is used as movies ironic prologue  \nthen  instead of single narrator  scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards  \nthis multiple points of views  both in terms of narration and various subjective shots  only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation  \nsame ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack  \nnostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easylistening 1950s pop songs  while depression  paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s  \nbut the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment  almost pastoral  easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed  \nhowever  thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people  \nsuch scenes  although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings  became very popular among other directors in 1990s  \nfragmentary character of the screenplay  which doesnt have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes  gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese  \nhe uses this structure of film to experiment  and most successful of such experiments is hilarious  a day in life  segment near the end of the film  \nanother essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents  \nthe most respectable among them is robert de niro  but his character  who happen to be most quiet and businesslike member of criminal trio  gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues  \njoe pesci deserved his  oscar  for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy  and his lines  including adlibs  probably represent the most memorable element of the film  \nray liotta  although equally talented  perhaps doesnt look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film  \nliottas henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of lowlevel street thugs  \nliotta  on the other hand  improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction  \nlorraine bracco is  on the other hand  very effective and believable as karen hill  wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband  \npaul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso  and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering smalltime gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave  \nas a combination of clever sociological study  black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do  work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time  \nbecause of this achievement  and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers  this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s  \n', 'pos'], ['there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie  \naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences  while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything fullcircle  \nfor fans of both genres  however  realism is key  \naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic  and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movies end  \non this

that had people spinning away from mission  impossible two years ago  \na certain number of people will be lost by this  but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times  \nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise  and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of postcold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck  \nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here  and ronin becomes a better movie because of it  \nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time  \nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the exspy sam  a man whos called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre  natascha mcelhone  recover a package  \nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast  especially once the requisite doublecrossing begins  and its role is skillfully penned by zeik  \nat times  however  zeiks tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission  impossible  de niro might easily become tom cruise  the package might become cruises computer disk  \nfortunately  the focus here is almost entirely on the package  whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the doublecross and why it happened  \nthe action content is impressive  and it lives up to the hints given in previews  \nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect fullblown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness  \nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish  but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots  \nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end  a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movies open  \nconsidering these factors its good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well  and its another good bet this month  \nsince

is a funny  talented man  and he is funny in this film  \nhe has lots of positive energy and  unlike most comical actors  really manages to play people like this realistically  \nthis film also requires a lot of physical humor that ive never seen dreyfuss perform  and he does a great job  \njenna elfman  who plays veronica mecilli  a scientist who wants in on krippendorfs work  is also very funny and appealing here  \nand the kid actors are great  as well  \nbut were talking about the script from hell  \nthis is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen  \nbut the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it  \nall the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew  \nno  the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and meanspirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched  \nfurthermore  the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless  \ntake  for instance  the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex  \nthey get all decked out in the tribe getup  complete with paint to darken their skin  \nkrippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe  \nnow  i saw this scene coming from a mile away  but i said to myself   no  that would be far too tasteless  \ntheres no way theyll do that    oh \ngod   \nthey did do it  \nits there  \ni was almost more appalled by the fact that this didnt bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film  \ni found it deplorable  \nand when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it  he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice  \nthe film is filled with scenes like these  \nthey not only insult the audience  but they insult the types of people that the film portrays  \nit would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists  yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon  \nand watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining  but i think that most members of the onscreen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes  \nif i were an anthropologist  this film would insult me immensely  \nmoving right along  the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes  \nsure  dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny  and it allows for some entertaining scenes  but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes  \nit is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film  \nhis character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar  and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does  \ni suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case  but for the purposes of good taste  i would have expected something  \nno  this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues  and the writer of the film  charlie peters  didnt include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad  \nin fact  its his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing  and he continually shrugs off her warnings  \ni suppose its important to admit that this is a funny film  \ndreyfuss and elfman  and many of the contrived and insulting scenes  add up to a picture that is anything but boring  \nand if youre less serious than i  you probably will enjoy it  \ni  however  cant get past these elements  \nkrippendorfs tribe is being marketed as a family comedy  but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldnt be learning  \nwith a little more insight into its story and themes  this could have been a good movie  \n', 'neg'], ['  desperate measures  is a generic title for a film thats beyond generic  \nits also a depressing waste

far better use  \nsan francisco cop frank connor  garcia  is a single parent with a troubling dilemma  his son matt  joseph cross  is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission  \neven worse  the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe  michael keaton   currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society  \nconnor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery  hes at first reluctant  but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital  \nwhen he does make a run for it  connor offers close pursuit  but for different reasons than his superiors  including the crusty brian cox   they want to take mccabe down  while connor needs to keep him alive  or all hope is lost for his little boy  \none misstep  desperate measures  makes is in its underdevelopment of matts illness  \nwhats needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works  there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country  and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow  \ntake  for example  a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital  \nthe police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him  and what does connor do  \nhe shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight  \nconnor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of  and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son  \nwhatever  \nto be fair  though  the lack of story background is the least of the movies problems  \nfirst and foremost is how cheaply  desperate measures  trades the potential of its opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour  \nonce mccabe escapes  the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills  \nthere are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away  \nalso  the movie is so intent on giving you a hootinducing  lipsmacking villain  the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter  natch  that it completely casts garcias frank connor by the dullsville wayside   desperate measures  appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist  and the movies headscratcher of a sendoff confirms this  \nthere is some good to be found amongst this mess  particularly in the acting department  \ncast against type  michael keatons understated menace is highly effective  \nalthough hes not given much believable to work with  andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord  \njoseph cross  as garicias ailing son  is surprisingly unsentimental  and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos  \nthis cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending  but most is lost  \nit goes without saying that  desperate measures  needs an operation of its

arrived in theaters  all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a

movies failure  \nit appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the  unseen  terrors  and it was about as scary as a dust bunny  \nso special effects or not  if the story isnt the least bit scary  you arent going to end up with a very frightening movie  \nthe thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern  \ndern is always great  and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie  \nas i sat through the seemingly endless

because of zetajones  \nill admit that i would have never seen this thing if she werent in it  \nbut the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets  \nthey take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients  \nthere really isnt much of a story here  \njust endless setups so director jan de bont can

\nthen we have the set  \nwhen i first saw the house  i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it  \nbut it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the

and a mirrored circular room that revolves  \nwhat part did these rooms play in the story  \nabsolutely none  \nthey were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent

supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role  \nthe haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999s horror movies  the blair witch project  \nthe haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget  while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares  \nboth prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film  \nif the story sucks  its all downhill from there  \nmy advice  \nif you are looking for special effects  go rent star wars  \nif its scares you want  rent halloween  \neither way  its probably in your best interests to skip the

say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two  \nit also sports a new alien with 4 legs  \ni wont say how  but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle  which i am sure will be explored in alien 4  \nsigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character  \nher scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination  \nthe rest of the cast is also quite good  \nnotably  charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109  \nalien 3 has a very distinct look  \nthis is due largely to its director  david fincher  \nmr  fincher  who until now has only directed music videos and commercials  has done an incredible job here  \nhis direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no  alien  film has before  \nfor mr  fincher  i see a long prosperous career ahead of him  \nthe music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry  \nelliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the  alien  series been set in  \nthis time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii  james horners aliens   \nthis score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring  \nthis is a great score  \nthe ending to alien 3 is quite good  \nthere were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up  but it played very nicely  \ni will not ruin the ending for you  \ngo see the film  \ni consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season  \nalien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien  \nand when they make alien 4  perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in  \n', 'pos'], ['i know that  funnest  isnt a word  \n  fun  is a noun  and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective  \nbut thats the word that came to me

famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures  \npart of what made the  wallace  films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new  \n  the wrong trousers   for example  pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks  and  a close shave  owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories  \nbut in the hands of park and

brilliant in its execution  \nconsider this  since july of last year  ive seen dozens upon dozens of  blair witch project  parodies  on television  on the radio  and online  \nout of all those  maybe

never the sole focus of any scene  \nif youve never seen  indiana jones   the chase sequence is still fun  \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is  rocky remains an interesting character  \npark  lord  and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood  and as a result   chicken run  is filled with visual and verbal

straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swingdancing sequence  \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades  the chicken vs  egg dilemma  \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome  but as with most of  chicken run   it comes as a delightful surprise  \nthe film manages to cross all barriers  it should be accessible to both children and adults  brits and yanks  rats and chickens  \nthe animation is firstrate  \nremember that this was all

asshole  majors  barry bostwick  shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show  \nthe story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend  \nin the early 70s  stage actor turned firsttime playwright richard obrien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy bmovies he had grown up with as a child  set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design  \nthe result was the stage play the rocky horror show  which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england  \nthe play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later  in october of 1974  \nthe film version  now titled the rocky horror picture show  was released in 1975    \nand immediately tanked at the box office  \nwhether it was because fox wasnt quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didnt quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined  but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop  \nit seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters  \na year later  something entirely strange and magical happened  \nprints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country  and it was then that a whole new audience found the film  \nthis new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film  acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played  yelling rude comments at the screen  and just generally having a good time  \nword quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture shows life as the ultimate cult film was born

there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance  \nthe castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual  in the galaxy of transylvania   who are lead by the eccentric fishnetstocking wearing mad scientist dr  franknfurter  tim curry   \nfranknfurter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form

bad in a really good sort of way   but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film  \nby the time the credits role  it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters  and one really gets the feeling that richard obrien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy bmovies his film is based on  \nwhen i say that the walltowall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that  once you hear them  they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity  \nit goes without saying that the  time warp  is the most popular song in the film  \neven people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song  \nwhat those who havent seen the movie dont know though  is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment  \nmy personal favorite is  over at the frankenstein place   but  dammit janet  is also maddeningly catchy  \ntim currys vocals on the

barry bostwick    \nfrightening    features no less than four songs   rose tint my world    dont dream it    wild and untamed thing   and  im going home    all of which are immensely singable  \nthe films true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though  \ndespite the catchiness of the songs  this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadnt have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show  \nwatching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans  unless you dont mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place   \nnote  director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film  in the form of a sequel  resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment  which picks up with brad and janet

wishes to claim janet as his own  \nobrien returned as a writerperformer on the project  as did quinn  campbell  and gray in performance capacity only   but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the

released for its 20th anniversary   \nif you are one of those people who cant get enough of the film  this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites  \nin an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film  fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that itll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all  \nthe film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1  85  1  enhanced for 16x9 televisions   \nthe film is presented in two different versions  the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called  superheroes   \nfor ambitious viewers  the disc also includes a hidden version  located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner  which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen  \noriginally  the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz  with the first half of the it seen in black and white  and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number   \nmost reports  including a documentary on the disc  say that the color was supposed to appear when franknfurter first shows up in the elevator  but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version  depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced  \nthe film contains a commentary track by show creator  and faithful handyman  richard obrien and costar patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable  and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and halfnaked on freezing cold sets  which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews   \nthe two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell  but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore  and there are quite a few   \nfox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments  \nthe first feature  and the most simple  is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is  \nthe second feature is an audience participation track  which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show  \nmost of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off  but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter  \nthe final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd  where a pair of lips will appear onscreen during certain scenes of the film  mostly during the musical numbers  that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote  \nwhen selected  you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world  \nonce the segment is over  you are deposited right back into the film where you left off  \nthe first disc also contains a few dvdrom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player  \nthere is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation  a video jukebox  a you dont know jackstyled trivia game  which is about as bare bones a you dont know jack parody as it can be   and a bizarre madlibs styled word game known as riffraffs story lab  \nlinks to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvdrom portion of the disc  \nthe second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras  \nformer literock video channel turned music historians vh1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the  behind the music  rocky horror  special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here  as well as a popup video for the meat loafsung  hot patootie   \nthe  behind the music  segments are all very interesting  especially richard obriens jaunt through the castle  which is now a hotel   where the film was originally shot  \nthere are also extensions of the sarandon  bostwick  quinn  obrien  and meat loaf interviews  \nas far as extras for the film itself go  there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here  \none of which is just the  superheroes  number available in the uk version  but there is also another rare musical number presented here called  once in a while   \na series of alternate takes are also presented here  but none of them are really much of a revelation  except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwicks pants   \nfor the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia  a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here  \nrounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show  two theatrical trailers  proclaiming that the film is  a different sort of jaws    a still gallery  and two singalongs  for  toucha toucha touch me  and  sweet transvestite    \nfoxs special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives   youre lucky    \nim lucky

receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format  \nas with their excellent dvds of the abyss  fight club  independence day  and the sound of music  fox shows that they have most certainly made the

novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart  \nthe difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when  in fact  the cavemans valentine is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless  again like mcfarlanes spawn  while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts  \nit is no small detail that our hero  romulus  is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life  in

genre in both style and substance  \nfor starters  classifying seven as a  thriller  would not be an altogether complete classification of this film  \nwhile i was genuinely thrilled throughout  i would rather call seven an  intense drama   because that is what it deliversmeaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up  \npart of director david finchers accomplishment is in style  \nhe seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as  simple  as a corpse  \nand visually  fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in alltoorealistic and graphic terms  courtesy of rob bottins alwaysgrisly special effects   \nthrow in the appropriate but nottobeunderestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene  \nthese scenes alone are quite impressive  as fascinating as they are harrowing  \nyet  seven is more than just a technical accomplishment  \nin addition to style  fincher supplies substance  \nseven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand  and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society  \ndetective william somerset  morgan freeman  is a man who has nearly given up on the world  \nits easy to see why  \nthe world doesnt make sense  \n  somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct  \nafter knocked down and robbed of his wallet  the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes   \nwhy should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and  picking up the pieces  he will be able to catch the killer  \nsomersets new partner  david mills  brad pitt  has not given up on the world  perhaps because he is still young  and perhaps by having this optimism hes naive in this films portrayal of the world   \nhe completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope  \nhowever  davids wife  gwyneth paltrow  has so much fear of her urban surroundings  she isnt even sure if she wants to  tell  her husband about her recent pregnancy  let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment  \nthese three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered  \nand in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world  fincher gives us support for  why  they feel the way they do  \nbut if theres one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey  it has to be the killer  john doe  kevin spacey   \nsevens payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does  \none important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a  psycho   with no motives behind his slayings  \nthis is exactly the mistake mills makes  \nin the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes  were allowed to see that doe is  in his mind  merely a product of society  \nhes a killer who kills those who are bringing society down  \nin his mind he didnt kill  innocent  people  and  perhaps  they were not completely innocent  but  then again  who is    \nhes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent  \nreally  seven doesnt just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwedup john doe is  \nseven makes larger statements about how screwedup society is  hinting that societys degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does  \nbesides the stylistic and largerissue arguments for seeing this film  i recommend seven because it is  after all  also a very slick and wellmade thriller  \nit features exciting plot developments  commanding performances  lots of suspense  and a conclusion that is chilling  riveting  and quite unfair  \nbut then again  its a cruel

the series  and is a big step down from  1996s  first contact   which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different  \nin   insurrection   however  it plays like a lowrent episode of the

guess  even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons  \nthe film opens on the wrong note  of course  with a quote from mark appearing before any

in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian  they use his gorgeous  adagio of spartacus and phrygia   ad nauseum   used in an attempt to give the film some emotion  but instead feels as if it

things about   porkys   is how jawdroppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers  \nthe four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters  and we learn very little about

they are not   but one thing is for sure  they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny  only humiliating  \nto prove how outoftouch this socalled comedy is  compare it to other more serious 80s films about teenagers  and it looks even worse in comaprison  \nany of the john hughes pictures  such as 1984s  sixteen candles   or  1985s  the breakfast club   put   porkys   at an

often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels  stories  comic books or movies  \noften science fiction aficionados find material  previously labelled as science fiction  to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror  or rather simple technothriller  \nin such cases  mistakes are understandable  genre boundaries are never clearly marked  \nbut  i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic  \nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago  when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff  1983 film directed by philip kaufman  \nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits  \nbut the right stuff film isnt even fiction  \nit was based on the nonfiction book by tom wolfe  covering the early years of american space program  \nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base  major test site for experimental planes  \nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier  \nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado  \nbut one quiet pilot  chuck eager  played by sam shaped  succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots  determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records  \nten years later  soviets have launched  sputnik  marking the beginning of the space age  \nin order to regain national prestige  us government decides to be the first to send man into space  \nbest air force  navy and marine pilots are recruited into program  but not yeager  because he lacks college education and desired allamerican image  \nin one of critics polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s  \nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufmans film looks quite atypical for its time  \nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s  age when hollywood used to make films larger than life  \nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker  \nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original  memorable movies  \nthe right stuff was the last of them  swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual  risktaking  artsy  projects  \nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film  \nthe plot is almost nonexistent and not very coherent  the story  featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes  shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots  embodied in yeager  to new generation of the astronauts  \nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist  yeager  who also appears in small cameo  remains the true hero of the film  but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives  making this movie into ensemble piece  \nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents  until that specialised only for bit or character roles  \nsam shepard is great as yeager  war hero whose greatest achievement  breech of the sound barrier  remained obscured in history books  probably due to his own modesty  \non the surface  he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues  but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases  \nshepards performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as cleancut marine  and future politician  john glenn  \nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper  and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom  superbly played by fred ward  \nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and  arguably  first american man in space alan shepard  \nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too  barbara hershey  pamela reed  veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots wives  \nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher  but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vicepresident lyndon b  johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch  \ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufmans superb direction  \nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time  \nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert  as virtual unknowns  far away from strict rules and discipline  \neverything seems natural yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world  \nin that setting  its quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights  \nbut the times are changing  ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war  and  natural  pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined  conventional pilots  \ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy  and their job is subjected to strict rules  meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats  publicityseeking politicians and uncaring scientists  like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun  played by scott beach  only to preserve their most basic human dignity  \nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence  while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity   mercury  astronauts receive fame and fortune  although some of them even before going in the space  \nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufmans superb use of poetic movie language  \nediting is great  and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion  the same image would be copied in many latter films   \nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military  which provided authentic locations and period equipment  he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights  \nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space  \nanother fine contribution of this film is  oscar  awarded musical score by bill conti  i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it  \nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy  \nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period  \nthis film is great  and its cult status is well deserved  but there are some minor flaws  \nsome of the  mercury  astronauts arent fleshed out enough  although being played by fine actors  like lance henriksen   \nfilm also lacks proper closure  \non the other hand  most logical conclusion of the film  landing on the moon  would require this film to be more than six hours long  \nalso  some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians  who were portrayed as evil monsters  just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagans america  \nin some of contemporary interviews  kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible  and in order to do that  he portrayed russians not as they were in real life  but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s  \ntime has passed  now we dont see astronauts as heroes  \nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions  those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers  \nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up  \nbut this film  sentimental reminder of the times  when future began   perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow  mercury  astronauts footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky  \nand even if they decide to stay on earth  they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema  \n', 'pos'], ['note  some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  \nbe forewarned  \nits rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylors first feature film  dream with the fishes  when the plodding  tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup  \nany hopeful expectations  however  are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatchedbuddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the films latter half  \nthe films central characters are terry  david arquette   a depressed  lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident  and nick  brad hunt   a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill  \nnick lives in the apartment building across from terry  who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz  kathryn erbe  with his trusty set of binoculars  but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a halfdrunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge  unconvincingly vowing suicide  \nnick casually asks for terrys wristwatch  and eventually cons terry into a trade  the watch for a bottle of pills  \nof

handful of weeks left   terrys compassion kicks in  and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement  terry will agree to bankroll the dying nicks lifelong fantasies  and nick will fulfill terrys death wish by killing him  \nthis is a promising premise  and mr  taylors film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point  but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters  terry is a repessed  mournful character who wants to die  while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live  and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits  and where the straightlaced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character  \nthis is bythenumbers plotting  buddy movieroad movie redux  \nhowever  dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline  but by the characters which carry the story  it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic  if not likeable  \nunfortunately  that is not the case here  where both of the films leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying  giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights  and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits  \nfar from a romp  this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt  and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond  \nmr  taylors dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes  while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone  it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived  witness such lines as  you should have asked something more interesting  like do you enjoy the pain   \n see  thats provocative  leaves room for further questions    \nthe film enjoys a few inspired moments  the urn scene  a session of nude bowling  the policeman joining in on terry and nicks acid trip  but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between  and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes  \nthis occurs particularly often during the films opening sequence  as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital  im realising that this is  intended  to be funny  although nary a smile crept upon my lips  which is probably due to the obvious fact that its painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts  sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nicks scheme of tricking him  this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes  \nthe entire sequence is  then  clearly an exercise for character exposition  with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability  \namong the cast  coming off best is david arquette  the current master in the portrayal of meek  squirming  stammering freshfaced characters  he would have been terrific as the lead for george huangs swimming with sharks  who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry  \nmr  taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique  where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated  as opposed to a bright  crisp look for the smalltown scenes  \nthe charge of dream with the fishess protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me  i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters  and indeed  in many cases have i been in the minority  supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult  audienceunfriendly nature of their characters  \nfor dream with the

about instinct is the halfhearted attempt at philosophical depth  \nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one  he thinks that humans are  takers   that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas  \ni can sympathize with that  but only when its in a compelling film  \nthis is the kind of stupid movie  just like patch adams  in which a big group of

some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers  \nbe forewarned  \njames tobacks return to directing after a eightyear layoff  two girls and a guy  is a film which is comprised  more or less  of just that  one guy  blake  robert downey jr    two girls  carla  heather graham  and lou  natasha gregson wagner   one primary setting  blakes absurdly spacious bachelor apartment   and a great deal of dialogue  \nembracing a near realtime approach  this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr  toback for his bantering characters  \nfortunately  the films cast is up to the challenge  and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters  while admittedly variable  are occasionally wickedly amusing  \nthe films setup is fairly generic in nature  and opens rather unpromisingly  \nwe meet selfpossessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou  both waiting outside a soho loft  \nas they engage in idle chatter  it is revealed that theyre both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport  and it doesnt take long for them to come to the realisation that theyre being twotimed by the same guy  \nmore indignant with him than catty with each other  the duo break into blakes loft and await his arrival for a confrontation  \nits when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride  \nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr  downey jr   blake is a cad  all right  but a captivatingly dynamic  blusterous  and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights  \nits fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat  and perhaps the films best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return  allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others  but by his own innate behaviour  \nwhether hes flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi  or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds  carla  lou  and his unseen sickly mother   its never less than wildly entertaining and insightful  \nthough at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a oneman show  a typical afternoon in the life of blake  if you will  carla  and then lou  reveal themselves  and the sparks begin to fly  \n  one of the great touches in the film is how blake  when startled by carlas unannounced appearance  begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cats out of the bag   \ndoubleteamed by the understandably aggrieved women  who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful  they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy   an increasinglyflustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even selfrighteous declarations against their verbal jabs  \nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters  two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was offlimits for this film  \nhowever  itd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lous outrage to full featurelength  and its as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel  \nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever  the films tempo loses its liveliness  the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion  and several sequences fall flat  \nsubtle and notquitesubtle allusions are made  a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall   and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale  \none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla  \ntwo girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter  longrunning dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene  contractuallyobligated to deliver an rrated film  mr  toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaleddown versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc17 rating in favour of an r  and while admittedly titillating  the net effect of the vignette on the films thematic narrative is rather dubious  \nif anything  two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr  downey jr   whose versatility is put to the test in this film  \nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled  from selfassured to disconcerted  yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered  \nits a wonderful performance in a role customtailored for him  mr  toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr  downey jr  was arrested on drug charges  and its hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character  in a monologue to his mirrored reflection  blakes selfchiding to  get his shit together  is disquieting in its resonance  \nwhile mr  downey jr  s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film  both actresses are solid in more broadlyobserved roles  \nms  graham is quickly becoming one of americas more daring actresses  involving herself in three successive risky projects  two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank  while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman  \nshes quite appealing here  playing a character at once both dainty and sultry  \nmeanwhile  ms  gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying  or  like me  endearing  \nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses  but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox  \nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days  filmed mostly in sequence  and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout  \ntwo girls and a guy has an agile  spontaneous sort of feel  and one senses that mr  toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors  \nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact  it doesnt feel constricted  the expansive apartment setting is wellused to vary the background  and mr  toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner  \ntwo girls and a guy falls short of its potential  but thanks to some stellar work by mr  downey jr   its still often an enjoyable  bitingly funny romp  particularly as we watch the surprisinglyresilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends  \n  im an actor   he tells them at one point  using the ol triedandtested

story about gatewood  \nthe difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting  \nwes studi  cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans  was perfect choice for geronimo  not only because he resembles geronimo  but because he induces a lot of passion in his role  \ncontrary to him  we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk

trick  theyd have you thinking the story was going one way  then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion  \n  me  myself  irene   by contrast  seems to have been made by folks who looked at  mary  and saw only the surface grossness  missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work  \nhaving been produced by the same guys who made  mary    irene  seems like an even bigger disappointment  \nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor  taking shots at race  midgets  albinos  mental illness  and all manner of bathroom jokes  \nbut they havent come up with a way

charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions  \nthis doesnt really happen  nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on  so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it  \nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point  involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called  appropriately   whitey

the farrellys had outsmarted themselves  \nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked  \nbut i dont believe it  good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style  \nif the farrellys are indeed good  smart filmmakers  and i still think they are   theyll rebound just fine

whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme  \nto reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much  but what ensues is a series of bloody  and i do mean bloody  confrontations  each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening  \nevery act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrators eyes  but we  the audience  are made privy to the  big picture  and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person  \nthis aspect of the story  along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality  one gets the sense that if guns and  in one case  shovels  were not available  some of these characters would claw each other to death  are the most effective components of the film  \nthe coens might have done well to title the film  fear and loathing in texas   \nsome have labeled  blood simple as a modernday noir  but  while i am not an expert on either genre  it seems more like a horror movie than anything else  \nthe coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters  and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one  relatively  innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive  \nthat said   blood simple  is a very good horror movie  the fear and suspense here are genuine  \nthe coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards  such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun  discharging it as it skitters across the floor  or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film  \nthat said   blood simple  is not exactly flawless  \nfor one thing  the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times  i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover  or at least thought they did   but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder  \nand although they at least didn  t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife  the coens also arent quite immune to horror cliches  they indulge in a prolonged deadguyseemstohavecomebacktolifebutthenwefindoutitsonlyadream scene that had me rolling my eyes  \nthe film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film  \n  blood simple  is not quite the masterpiece of neonoir that many seem to think it is  but its a decent movie and it showcases the coens ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but nonexploitative manner  \ni would firmly recommend it

of two things  either a muchneeded revisionist look at slavery in the south  or in the words of film critic leonard maltin   a trashy potboiler  that  appeals only to the sm crowd   \nactually  i

heavyweight boxer ken norton   \nalthough the movie never explains it  a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley  \naccording to the movie  mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves  \nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him  \nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves  \nmeanwhile  hammond has married his cousin  blanche  susan george   because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild  \nhammond  however  is happier spending nights with his  bed wench   the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex  \nit is quickly apparent that hammond  despite his overt racism  is more in love with his bed wench  a sensitive slave girl named ellen  brenda sykes   than he is with blanche  \nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had  pleasured  her before he did  \nof course  its fine that hes slept with numerous slave girls  but the fact that his wife  a  white lady   had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her  \nso blanche is usually left lonely and sexstarved while hammond is sleeping with ellen  \nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child  \nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a halfblack child  although its okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond   so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth  and hammond poisons blanche  \nhammond then finds mede  shoots him twice in the shoulder  and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water  \nyes  you read right  the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive  \njudging only by the plot   mandingo  is pure sexploitation  \nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible  with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society  \nwhen  mandingo  was released in 1975  it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail  this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs  \ndramatically   mandingo  is weak and unfocused  and historically its mostly confused  \nif one were to judge history by this film  it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality  not economics  \nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working  except for a few house servants  \nthe men spend most of the time sitting around  while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner  \nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves  but  mandingos  overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick  although theres plenty of violence  fights  vicious beatings  shootings  and the aforementioned human boiling sequence  thrown in for good measure   \nsome tried to write off  mandingo  as a blaxploitation film  one of a number of quicklymade  lowbudget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies  but its not that easy  \n  mandingo  was studiofinanced by paramount pictures  and produced by dino de laurentiis  the grandiose italian producer behind such

effectsladen action movies including  20  000 leagues under the sea   1954  and  fantastic voyage   1966   as well as such superior suspense films as  the narrow margin   1952   \nthe script  based on

\njames mason  perry king  and susan george were wellknown and respected actors  mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt   and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career  \nso why is  mandingo  so bad  \na number of reasons  including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job  \nwexlers script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive  it combines stereotyped slavetalk   yessuh  massuh    stereotyped southern white trash talk   fer whutre you gittin outta bed     and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk   if you see me hang  you gonna know you killed a black brother     \nfleischers direction is clumsy  especially during the fight scenes  and all the actors give weak performances  especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable  \nnevertheless  credit should be given where credit is due  \ndespite its exploitative nature   mandingo  was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery  \nuntil then  there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery  \neven classics such as  gone with the wind   1939  can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter  \n  mandingo  reassessed the south  and showed that it wasnt all beautiful plantations  green fields  and pretty sunsets  \nbut all this is constantly undermined by the films negligible pointofview  it claims to see things from the black perspective  but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners  \nwith a little more maturity and different handling   mandingo  might have been an effective  worthwhile film  \nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery  it never deals with them  \nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile  but wexlers script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing  \nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner  but  mandingo  never does it  \nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in  schindlers list   1993   by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid  \nthe difference between that film and  mandingo  is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair  unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma  \n  mandingo  is satisfied to simply show some skin  and because of that  its  trashy potboiler  nature overshadows any potential social

supersoldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors  for the good of a planet  schwarzeneggers terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine  the t1000  and jeanclaude  a former universal soldier  has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of  you guessed it  newer model soldiers  \nconsidering the poor box office performance of soldier  its amazing that this project was ever given the goahead  \nluc devereaux  van damme  was the sole remaining universal soldier  or unisol for short   until he was returned to a normal  if muscular  human form  \nin this sequel  technically the fourth film in the series  following two straighttovideo duds that were ignored here plotwise   luc is now a human trainerconsultant of sorts for the unisol program  \nworking with dylan cotner  xander berkeley  who interestingly also appeared in t2   the unisol program has engineered a tougher  fiercer fighting force with the help of supercomputer seth  \nunfortunately  upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government  seth takes control of his soldiers  killing everyone in the building except for luc  his partner maggie  his daughter hillary and erin  a reporter trapped inside  \nthe rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive  while beating up a group of nearindestructible soldiers  most notably romeo  popular wrestler goldberg   \nthere are lots of fights  gun battles  lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility  \nthere are so many clich  s in this film that it is almost painful to watch  \nluc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on  and in the course of a single night  they go from bickering to falling for each other  to kissing  \nerin is a patheticallywritten character  people are getting brutally gunned down all around her  and yet  not only does this not seem to frighten her  but she finds time to remind luc that she  isnt leaving without her story   \nwhatever  \nother laughable moments include a  luc going to a strip club to get internet access  what   and b  a group of rangers  who after having been given good advice  luc tells them that their weapons are useless  and shows them a specific gun which should work better   choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway  guess who wins the battle    \nnot one single scene in universal soldier  the return has any originality to it  \nwhen fuelled by don davis loud  driving music score  the films many fights become almost passable  but mostly are full of the same ol jeanclaude moves  \ndirector mic rodgers  a former stunt coordinator  keeps the action coming at a rapid pace  with only a few token serious moments to be found  \nhis past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows  tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion  \nif only jeanclaude werent getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li  rodgers could probably have made a decent action film  \nto place the blame squarely at van dammes feet  however  is an injustice  \nim not sure that anyone  not even robert deniro or edward norton  could make writers william malone and john fasanos script sound good  \none particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access  \nhe cringes  looks down and mutters  uh    uhm    \nthey all do  i saw it on 60 minutes  \neh he he he  the scripts and indeed the entire films only saving grace is goldberg  \nhe chews up every scene he is in  obviously enjoying his role immensely  \nhe even gives the film a few laughs  as he mutters things like  i really dont like that guy  every time he fails to kill luc  \nsadly  his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier  the return into anything better than a belowaverage action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straighttovideo  \n', 'neg'], ['richard linklaters  slacker   made in 1991 for a budget of only 23  000  immerses itself in the twentysomething  collegetown

morality  the subtle messages in pop culture  and such  \nask them what theyve been doing lately  and theyll more likely than not reply   oh  you know  just hanging out   \nlinklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters  the camera follows one person for a few minutes  then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person  who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door  \n  \n  \n  \nits certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk  some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas  some of them are just plain weird  and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are  \nthe opening monologue  delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver  tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film  \nother characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy  while groups of pseudointellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle briberybased morality in  scoobydoo   \nfor the most part  however  the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types  \nnear the beginning  a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks  warning him about government

tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below  \nthe only problem with  slacker  is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end  \nsince linklater only spends a few minutes with each character  the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while  \nthere are only so many times you can hear   hey  whats going on   \n  not much  what are you up to   \n  nothing really  just hanging around   before it gets on your nerves  the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization  \nand the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half  a jfk buff  for example  seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist  and many of the characters just generally arent as weird or unique  \ninstead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first  linklater shows us the oddballs first  then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too  \n  slacker  is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy  whatever its flaws  and its status as a cult classic is welldeserved  \ni just cant help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order  \n', 'pos'], ['boy  what a great movie   \nkeanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together  the director of the fugitive  andrew davis  back

northeast crowd  \ni hope it gets the national distribution it deserves  \ni give it a b  \n', 'pos'], ['having not seen   who framed roger rabbit  in over 10 years  and not remembering much besides that i liked it then  i decided to rent it recently  \nwatching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is  \naside from the fact that its a milestone in animation in movies  its the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters  have them interact  and make it convincingly real  and a great entertainment its also quite an effective comedymystery  \nwhile the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original  especially baby herman  and watching them together is a lot of fun  \nthe story begins in hollywood in 1947  \ncartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work  so hardboiled private detective eddie valiant  bob hoskins  is called in by studio head r  k  \nmaroon  alan tilvern  to try to help get rogers mind back on work  \nmaroon thinks that rogers wife  jessicas  possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots  \nvaliant takes some photos of jessica playing  patty cake with marvin acme  stubby kaye   the owner of toontown  where all of the cartoon characters live  and takes them to maroon  \nupon seeing them  roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect  \nthe rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town  and eventually toontown  trying to clear rogers good name  \nalong the way they meet judge doom  christopher lloyd  a judgejuryand executioner type whos out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a toon   \nwho framed roger rabbit won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters  williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in   \ndirector robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production  which included hundreds of animators  \nalso bob hoskins performance should be credited  \nhe  in addition to the rest of the human cast  finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon costars  \naccording to the internet movie database  hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off  \nwho framed roger rabbit is a rare film  \none that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family  although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom   \ndo yourself a favor and rent it  ppppplease   \n', 'pos'], ['when andy leaves for cowboy camp  his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys  \none of these toys is wheezy  a penguin with a broken squeaker  \nwoody  tom hanks  saddles up andys dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy  \nwoody succeeds in his mission  but doesnt make it back to the house before al  the unscrupulous owner of als toy barn  recognizes woody as a rare collectors item and steals him  \nbuzz lightyear  tim allen  leads hamm  john ratzenberger   mr  potato head  don rickles   slinky dog  jim varney   and rex  wallace shawn  into the city to find their friend  \nmeanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped  \nal has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950s tv puppet show  woodys roundup  except for a woody doll  \nnow that the collection is complete  al plans to sell woody and his roundup gangbullseye the horse  jessie the cowgirl  joan cusack   and stinky pete the old prospector  kelsey grammer  to a toy museum in japan  \nthe gang is happy about the move  theyve been in storage for years waiting for woody  \nif woody doesnt go with them  theyll be closed up in a dark box again  possibly forever  \ntrying to convince him to stay with them  jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up  and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered  \nwhile woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy  buzz and the boys invade als toy barn  where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesnt know hes a toy  \nthe new buzz generates the movies biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on  zurgs fortress   i  e   als apartment building   \nthe original  toy story  won me over because its central themes reflected a grownup sensibility rather than the usual thisiswhatwethinkkidswanttohear  \nwhile most kids movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill  in  toy story  buzz discovered that he wasnt special  that he was just like everyone else  \nbuzz sank into a suicidal depression  but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy  \nin other words  its okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life  \nmost of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that were not space rangers and were never going to be  \n  toy story 2  addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie  \nwoody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded  abandoned  or sealed up in a dark box in the attic  \nthis is another big grownup theme  everything ends  \nthe theme is introduced early in the movie when woodys arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp  \non the shelf  woody meets wheezy  whos dusty  broken  and forgotten  \nthe other toys are shocked that woody has been  shelved   and they worry that woodys ride out to the 25cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt  \nafter hes stolen  woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals  \nof course  in spite of the heavy themes  toy story 2  explores  its also very funny  \nmost of the laughs come from the toys assault on als toy barn and on the apartment building  \nthe brief substitution of a new  still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise  id wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original  \nmost of the vocal performances are firstrate  \ntom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work  \nhowever  one voiceover also stands out as horribly miscast  \nkelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector  \nalthough he does a lot of voiceover work in commercials and on  the simpsons   as sideshow bob   grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice  \nhe doesnt have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete  \nthe animation is even better than in the first  \nespecially impressive were the textures of the figures  \nwe can now see the difference between flesh and plastic  in the first movie the people looked just like the toys  but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint  \nwe can also see that bo peep is porcelain  \nas you can tell from the longwinded phrasing common in the merchandising   disney and pixars toy story 2   this is pixars coming out party  \nto celebrate they appended their first project  a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball  to the beginning of the movie  \nthey made the short in 1986  which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then  \non the downside   toy story 2  follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale  and some sections tend to drag  \noverall  though  i had a great time and found  story 2  to be a worthy successor to the first  toy story   \nbottom line  this one really is fun for the whole family  \n', 'pos']]
